            captures the personal story of an individual confronting
            long-standing religious tradition in a small-town church setting. At
            a time when questioning faith is often stigmatized, James Larry
            Holmes Jr. courageously explores the reasons behind his departure.
            Loosely based on real experiences, this powerful narrative blends
            spiritual conflict, societal pressure, and the quest for truth. A
            compelling read for those interested in modern faith journeys and
            thoughtful religious critique."

                With a lifetime dedicated to service and leadership, the author brings a rich tapestry of experience
                that informs their unique perspective on managing difficult people. A retired military veteran and
                former police officer, they have honed skills in conflict resolution and interpersonal dynamics that
                are essential in today’s multifaceted environments. Currently serving as a Bi-vocational Senior Pastor
                and Substance Use Therapist, they intertwine their faith with practical counseling principles, making
                them a credible voice in the field of leadership and personal development.

                The author’s professional background is a compelling blend of military service, law enforcement, prison
                chaplain and community engagement. Having served in various capacities, they understand the intricacies
                of human behavior and the importance of effective communication. Their role as a church leader and
                therapist allows them to train, teach, and advise multiple congregations on strategies for effective
                leadership, counseling methodologies, and community development initiatives. This multifaceted experience
                enriches their insights into managing challenging interpersonal interactions.

                Educationally, the author possesses advanced degrees that underpin their expertise in leadership and counseling. Their formal training, combined with years of practical experience, fuels their passion for writing. The journey to authoring "Managing Difficult People Like Disciples" and “I’m Out, The reason why I’m Leaving the Church” and the “50 Lord Laws of Leadership” was born from a desire to share their knowledge and strategies with a broader audience. This book serves as both a guide and a resource, designed for anyone looking to enhance their skills in managing relationships, whether in the workplace, community, or personal life.
